Wasm Fun Dev Tools Notes

Was originally created by me (Kenny Fully) to encode and decode files with
base64. Now since I'm working with Wasm (WebAssembly) modules, This file will
be modified in the future with extra features and ease of use. If you have any
requests or suggestions please contact me in the issues section or at my email
kennyfully19881230@gmail.com with the title "Wasm Tools". Thank you very much
and may God bless you.
